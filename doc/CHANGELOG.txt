==========
CHANGELOG:
==========



	1.0.0 - Original by Jeff Minard

	1.2.0 - Added support for simple-cache ( cache_store() and cache_recall() )
			to speed things up a bit.
	      - Changed the hack for IE. Caching would detect one browser, and
	      	cache the wrong version for everyone else. Now instead of an img tag,
	      	the "img" is placed via background styles in a DIV that will work in
	      	compliant browsers, and will also work with IE.
	1.2.1 - A few simple changes
	      - Added simple-cache.php to the package.

        1.3.0 - Added multi-language support via PO- & MO-Files
        1.3.1 - Timeformat of sunrise/sunset/current-time is now well formated

        1.4.0 - Display the forecast with small images

        1.5.0 - New directory structure
        1.5.1 - Widget implemented
        1.5.2 - Admin Panel implemented
        1.5.3 - Added simple_cache plugin
        1.5.4 - Added the "doc" directory

        1.6.0 - Plugin completely rewritten (Code optimized)
